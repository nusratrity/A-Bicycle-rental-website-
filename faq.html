                        day (the day you return) and select the item you’d like to reserve. The system will display
                        estimated rental charges for the rental period you’ve indicated. With only a few exceptions
                        (e.g., very large groups), short-term reservations (1-2 hours) are not accepted.</p>

                        and the Confirmation Number that you’d like to cancel. Cancellations made 48 hours or more
                        before pick-up will receive a full refund of the deposit fee, less a $10 processing fee. If the
                        deposit fee is less than $10 then no refund will be given and the fee is reduced to the amount
                        already paid. Cancellations made less than 48 hours before pick-up are not eligible for a
                        refund.</p>

                    <p>Yes, cycling can be a dangerous activity and we want you to clearly understand these risks and

                        RentaBikeNow.com require the user to agree to terms and conditions, which includes a Liability
                        Release, Waiver, and Indemnification. You are also required to sign a print copy of this or

                        in essentially the same condition as it left the shop. If needed, check your credit card and
                        homeowner’s policy for possible coverage.</p>
