                <p>
                    <b>Spin</b> started in 2023 with the simple idea of offering an easy, sustainable way for
                    students to commute on campus. Initially, a small fleet of bikes was made available, and the service
                    quickly gained popularity. Today, we offer a wide range of bikes, including standard bicycles and
                    electric bikes, designed to fit different needs and preferences.
                <p>
                <p>
                    Our mission is simple: to provide a reliable and convenient way for people to enjoy cycling. Whether
                    you're a city commuter, an outdoor adventurer, or simply someone looking to enjoy a weekend ride,
                    we’ve got you covered.
