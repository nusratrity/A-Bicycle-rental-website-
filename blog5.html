        <h1>The Environmental Impact of Bicycle Rentals</h1>
        <img src="assets/eco 1.jpg" alt="Benefits of Cycling">
        <p>Bicycle rentals have emerged as a sustainable and eco-friendly transportation option, providing significant
            environmental benefits. With growing concerns about climate change and pollution, bicycles offer a clean
            alternative to motor vehicles, reducing carbon emissions and improving air quality.</p>

        <p>One of the most notable advantages of bicycle rentals is their ability to decrease the reliance on fossil
            fuels. Traditional vehicles contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, while bicycles operate on human
            power, producing zero emissions. By encouraging people to rent and ride bicycles, we can collectively reduce
            our carbon footprint and combat global warming.</p>

        <p>Additionally, bicycles help reduce traffic congestion in urban areas. Fewer cars on the road mean less noise
            pollution and lower fuel consumption. This shift not only benefits the environment but also promotes
            healthier and more efficient transportation systems.</p>

        <p>Another important impact of bicycle rentals is the preservation of green spaces. With fewer cars on the road,
            there is less need for large parking lots and road expansions, allowing urban planners to focus on creating
            parks and pedestrian-friendly zones. These green spaces enhance biodiversity and improve overall community
            well-being.</p>

        <p>Bicycle rentals also support sustainable urban mobility by integrating with public transportation systems.
            Many cities have implemented bike-sharing programs that complement buses and trains, making it easier for
            people to adopt eco-friendly travel habits. This integration reduces dependency on personal vehicles and
            encourages a culture of sustainability.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, bicycle rentals are more than just a convenient mode of transportâ€”they represent a step toward
            a greener and more sustainable future. By reducing emissions, easing traffic congestion, and preserving
            green spaces, they contribute to cleaner air and healthier communities. Embracing bicycle rentals can help
            us protect the planet and create a more eco-conscious society.</p>
