        <h1>5 Reasons to Switch to Campus Bicycle Rentals</h1>
        <img src="assets/about.jpg" alt="Eco-Friendly Transport">
        <p>With <span class="highlight">climate change</span> becoming a pressing global issue, eco-friendly transportation options are gaining traction. Bicycles, in particular, have emerged as a <span class="highlight">sustainable</span> and affordable means of commuting. They not only reduce carbon emissions but also promote a healthier lifestyle.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Eco-Friendly and Sustainable</strong>: Bicycles are one of the most environmentally friendly modes of transport. By choosing campus bicycle rentals, you are actively contributing to reducing carbon emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion, helping create a cleaner, greener environment for everyone.</p>

        <p>They also reduce noise pollution and make your campus surroundings more peaceful, contributing to a more serene academic atmosphere. Adopting bicycles as a transportation method is a key part of addressing climate change and reducing the reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Cost-Effective and Affordable</strong>: The costs of owning a car or personal bike can add up quickly, including insurance, maintenance, parking, and gas. Campus bicycle rentals eliminate these expenses, providing an affordable alternative that doesn’t require a long-term investment.</p>

        <p>Students can rent bicycles as needed, making it a budget-friendly solution for daily commuting. Whether it’s for getting to class or running errands, rental bikes offer great flexibility without the financial burden.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Health and Wellness Benefits</strong>: Cycling is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle strength, and boost overall fitness. With busy schedules, students often struggle to maintain regular exercise routines, but cycling provides an easy and enjoyable way to stay active.</p>

        <p>Riding a bike also promotes mental wellness by reducing stress and helping clear your mind. It’s a natural way to improve both physical and mental health while navigating the campus, leaving you feeling energized and refreshed.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Convenience and Flexibility</strong>: One of the greatest advantages of campus bicycle rentals is convenience. With bike stations located across the campus, you can easily pick up and return a bicycle whenever you need to go anywhere. Whether you’re running late for a class or have a few minutes to spare, there’s always a bike available when you need it most.</p>

        <p>No need to worry about parking spots, bike storage, or maintenance. You can simply grab a bike, ride to your destination, and return it to any nearby station. It’s a hassle-free way to get around campus with maximum flexibility.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Reduce Traffic and Improve Air Quality</strong>: Traffic congestion is a common problem on many college campuses. By switching to bicycle rentals, you help alleviate traffic jams and make commuting faster for everyone. Fewer cars mean less pollution and fewer greenhouse gases, improving air quality on campus and in the surrounding area.</p>

        <p>With a growing number of students choosing bikes over cars, campus bicycle rental programs play a key role in creating a more sustainable and livable campus environment, both now and in the future.</p>
